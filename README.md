# STEM_Python_Crypto

## Introduction

A short course for school children to become familiar with Python using codes and cyphers as a vehicle.  I am writing this course as a Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM) Ambassador, aiming to improve the take-up of these subjects among school children.
This is very much, "Work in Progress", and at the moment I am just capturing ideas and structure.
