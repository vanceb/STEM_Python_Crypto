# List of Challenge Ideas

* Calculate the 1000th prime number
    - Provide a basic algorithm for prime checking, and get them to create a
      program around it to get the 1000th number
    - 1000th prime number is the key needed for the next challenge
    - Cover "off by one" errors with hint pages
    - Advanced could be to optimize the algorithm for speed
* Calculate the most frequent word in a corpus of text
    - Introduces the use of Python Dictionaries
    - Introduces sorting
    - Most frequent word is the key to the next challenge
* Calculate the letter frequency in a paragraph of text and use the letter
  order as a key to the next challenge (Simpler than word freq...)
* Transposition cypher from the CIA website
    - cia.py
* Morse code
    - Create an encoder/decoder
    - Play sounds of the morse code being played...
